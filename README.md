A maturing yt frontend for Idefix and Pluto, packaged as an extension for yt.

## Installation

```shell
python -m pip install yt_idefix
```

## Supported formats

| Code   | format | supported since | additional dependencies |
|--------|:------:|:---------------:|-------------------------|
| Idefix | `.dmp` | v0.1.0          |                         |
| Idefix | `.vtk` | v0.3.0          |                         |
| Pluto  | `.vtk` | v0.9.0          |                         |
| Pluto  |  XDMF  | v1.1.0          | `h5py`                  |

## Usage

After importing `yt` itself, make sure to activate the extension
```python
import yt
import yt_idefix
```

Now `yt.load` will be able to read Pluto/Idefix output files.

### Dataset's Metadata
The metadata is automaticly parsed from data file, definitions header file and inifile when loading dataset.

definitions header file (`definitions.h` for Pluto, or `definitions.hpp` for Idefix) and inifile (`.ini` file) are assumed to be along with data file. Their paths can also be specified explicitly with paramerters `definitions_header` and `inifile`.

Besides, the geometry of dataset can be given by `geometry` parameter ("cartesian", "spherical", "cylindrical" and "polar")  when it cannot be parsed from file.

```
# Examples
ds = yt.load("data.0010.vtk", definitions_header="../definitions.h", inifile="example.ini")
ds = yt.load("data.0010.vtk", geometry='spherical")
```
### Unit System
The data are loaded as physical quantities with units. The default unit system is `cgs` in yt. This frontend can convert data from code units into `cgs` properly, based on the unit definitions from metadata.

Users are able to choose the unit displayed in two ways, through `unit_system`("code", "mks" and "cgs") and `unit_override`(only valid for Pluto).

```
# Examples on units
ds = yt.load("data.0010.vtk", unit_system='mks")

units_override = dict(length_unit=(100.0, "au"), mass_unit=yt.units.mass_sun)
ds = yt.load("data.0010.vtk", unit_override=unit_override) # Caution that other units will also be changed for consistency!!
```
Others units in the system will be consistently derived through given overided units, so there are some rules to override units:
1. Temperature unit is not allowed to be overrided (always in "K")
2. No more than three units are overrided at once.
3. When given less than three overrided units, base units in Pluto (ordered: velocity_unit, density_unit, length_unit) will be used for derivation
4. Following combinations are not allowed

```
{"magnetic_unit", "velocity_unit", "density_unit"},
{"velocity_unit", "time_unit", "length_unit"},
{"density_unit", "length_unit", "mass_unit"},
```

### Derived Fields
yt are able to provide some derived fields from existed fields, e.g. "cell_volum". Fields related to element species can be created according to primordial abundances of H and He, through `default_species_fields` ("neutral" and "ionized") parameters.

```
ds = yt.load("data.0010.vtk", default_species_fields="ionized")
```
## Experimental features

### Seamless plugin support
*new in yt 4.2 (unreleased) + yt_idefix 0.16*

`yt>=4.2` supports automatic
loading for external frontends, i.e., the extra import line (`import yt_idefix`)
will not be needed with this version.

This feature is marked as experimental until yt 4.2.0 is released.
In the mean time, this feature can be enabled by installing yt from source as, i.e.,
```shell
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/yt-project/yt.git
```

### Strecthed grids support
*new in yt 4.1 + yt_idefix 0.12*
- `yt_idefix>=0.12.0` natively supports `yt.SlicePlot` for streched grids
- `yt>=4.1.0` is required from `yt.ProjectionPlot`

Streched grids support is considered experimental as of yt 4.1
